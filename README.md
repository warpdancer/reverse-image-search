# Reverse Google Image Search

It seems like chrome is phasing out their reverse google image search context menu (when right clicking on an image). Originally, you could just right click the image you want, and just hit a selection on the context menu that would search the image for you on the fly.

Google has instead decided to use their crappy Google Lens in place of this useful functionality. 

## Installation

- Open Chrome/Brave and go to Manage Extensions
- Turn Developer Mode On
- Click "Load Unpacked" and select this cloned directory
- You should be good to go at this point; just right click any image and select "Reverse Image Search With Google"
